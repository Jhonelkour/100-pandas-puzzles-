# 🐼 100 Pandas Puzzles — My Practice Notebook

This repository contains my personal solutions and notes for the [100 Pandas Puzzles](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles) created by [ajcr](https://github.com/ajcr). These puzzles are designed to test and improve your data manipulation skills using the Python libraries `pandas` and `numpy`.
